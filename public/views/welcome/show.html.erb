    <h3>Visiting Special Collections</h3>
    <p>The Special Collections reading room is open to the general public from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, and on Saturdays during the fall and spring semesters from noon to 4 p.m. More information on Visiting Special Collections is available on our <a href="https://libraries.uh.edu/branches/special-collections/" title="Special Collections website">website</a>.
    Collections are non-circulating and must be used in the reading room. Weâ€™re happy to pull materials and have them ready upon your arrival -- just contact us using the request button found on each finding aid. Some finding aids contain digitized versions of collection materials, but in most cases viewing a collection in its entirety will require visiting the reading room.</p>
